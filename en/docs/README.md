# Volt Documentation

The following attempts to document all of the features of Volt.  While the code is always the final source of authority, we attempt to keep these docs as up-to-date as possible.

## App Layout

New volt apps come with a few folders/files out of the box:


| name            | description                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| app             | Contains the apps [components](docs/components.md) in subfolders |
| config          | Contains app configuration, and code to run on startup (initializers) |
| config.ru       | A special file used by [rack](http://rack.github.io/) compatible servers to start the app  |
| spec            | a folder for all rspec test (or specs).                          |
| Gemfile         | Specifies all gems the project depends on                        |
| Gemfile.lock    | A file generated by [bundler](http://bundler.io/) that tracks the specific gem version numbers |
| README.md       | A markdown file for your project                                 |

Most of your apps code will live in component folders inside of app.  Apps can be broken up into seperate components to help with code reuse and testing.  By default volt generates one component called "main".  When you are first learning, you can put everything in "main".

### Components

Components contain severial standard folders.

| name            | description                                                      |
|-----------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| assets          | your static assets: css, js, image, font, etc...                 |
| config          | component specific configuration and dependency management       |
| controllers     | Classes that orchistrate the presentation of the UI and connecting it to the models |
| lib             | Additional ruby code needed for the component                     |
| models          | Classes that manage data, permissions, validations, and business logic |
| views           | html files that are rendered on the browser to show the app      |

The next sections of these docs will take you through each of the parts of components before covering components in more detail.
