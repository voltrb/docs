# Channel

Controllers provide a `#channel` method, that you can use to get the status of the connection to the backend.  Channel's access methods are reactive and when the status changes, the watching computations will be re-triggered.  It provides the following:

| method      | description                                               |
|-------------|-----------------------------------------------------------|
| connected?  | true if it is connected to the backend                    |
| status      | possible values: :opening, :open, :closed, :reconnecting  |
| error       | the error message for the last failed connection          |
| retry_count | the number of reconnection attempts that have been made without a successful connection |
| reconnect_interval | the time until the next reconnection attempt (in seconds) |

## Channel Events

Sometimes you need to run code when the client connects or disconnects to/from the server.  In a controller on the client you can do:

```ruby
channel.on('connect') do
  .. connected ..
end

channel.on('disconnect') do
  .. disconnect ..
end
```
