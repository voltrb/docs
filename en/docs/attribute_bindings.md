# Attribute Bindings

Bindings can also be placed inside of attributes.

```html
<p class="{{ if is_cool? }}cool{{ end }}">Text</p>
```

## Two Way Attribute Bindings
There are some special features provided to make elements work as "two way bindings":

```html
<input type="text" value="{{ _name }}" />
```

Above if ```_name``` changes, the value in the text box will be updated.  The binding calls ```_name``` on the controller to fetch the name value. When a user types into the text box, the equivilent setter method will be called on the controller.  In this case ```_name=``` will be called on the controller and the new field value will be passed in.  This gives the effect of two way bindings, but you are able to change how data is updated (by defining a different setter).  We think this gives the benefits of both one way bindings and two way bindings.

## CheckBoxes

In the example above, if ```_name``` changes, the field will update, and if the field is updated, ```_name``` will be changed:

```html
<input type="checkbox" checked="{{ _checked }}" />
```

If the value of a checked attribute is ```true```, the checkbox will be shown checked. If it's checked or unchecked, the value will be updated to ```true``` or ```false``` respectively.

## Radio Buttons

Radio buttons bind to a checked state as well, except instead of setting the value to ```true``` or ```false```, they set it to a supplied field value.

```html
<input type="radio" checked="{{ _radio }}" value="one" />
<input type="radio" checked="{{ _radio }}" value="two" />
```

When a radio button is checked, whatever checked is bound to is set to the field's value.  When the checked binding value is changed, any radio buttons where the binding's value matches the fields value are checked.  NOTE: This seems to be the most useful behavior for radio buttons.

## Select Boxes

Select boxes can be bound to a value (while not technically a DOM property, this is another convenient behavior Volt adds).

```html
<select value="{{ _rating }}">
  <option value="1">*</option>
  <option value="2">**</option>
  <option value="3">***</option>
  <option value="4">****</option>
  <option value="5">*****</option>
</select>
```

When the selected option of the select above changes, ```_rating``` is changed to match.  When ```_rating``` is changed, the selected value is changed to the first option with a matching value.  If no matching values are found, the select box is unselected.
