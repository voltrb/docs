## Validations

Within a model class, you can setup validations.  Validations let you restrict the types of data that can be stored in a model.  Validations are mostly useful for the ```store``` collection, though they can be used elsewhere.

At the moment we only have two validations implemented (length and presence).  Though a lot more will be coming.

```ruby
    class Info < Volt::Model
      validate :_name, length: 5
      validate :_state, presence: true
    end
```

When calling save on a model with validations, the following occurs:

1. Client side validations are run; if they fail, the promise from ```save!``` is rejected with the error object.
2. The data is sent to the server and client and server side validations are run on the server; any failures are returned and the promise is rejected on the front-end (with the error object)
    - re-running the validations on the server side makes sure that no data can be saved that doesn't pass the validations
3. If all validations pass, the data is saved to the database and the promise resolved on the client.
4. The data is synced to all other clients.

More on validations can be found in the [source code](http://www.github.com/voltrb/volt/tree/master/lib/volt/models/validations.rb).
