# Routes

Routes in Volt are very different from traditional backend frameworks.  Since data is synchronized using websockets, routes are mainly used to serialize the state of the application into the url in a pretty way.  When a page is first loaded, the URL is parsed with the routes and the params model's values are set from the URL.  Later if the params model is updated, the URL is updated based on the routes.

This means that routes in Volt have to be able to go both from URL to params and params to URL.  It should also be noted that if a link is clicked and the controller/view to render the new URL is within the current component (or an included component), the page will not be reloaded, the URL will be updated with the HTML5 history API, and the params hash will reflect the new URL.  You can use the changes in params to render different views based on the URL.

More can be found on routes and the router in the [source code](http://www.github.com/voltrb/volt/tree/master/lib/volt/router).
