# Tasks

Sometimes you need to explicitly execute some code on the server. Volt solves this problem through *tasks*. You can define your own tasks by inheriting from ```Volt::Task```. Ruby files in a ```tasks``` folder, which end with ```_tasks.rb```, will be required automatically.

```ruby
# app/main/tasks/logging_tasks.rb

class LoggingTasks < Volt::Task
  def log(message)
    puts message
  end
end
```

Volt will automatically generate wrappers for you on the client side which will return a promise.

*Note that the classes on the server side use instance methods while the wrapper classes represent those methods as class methods*  For more information on using promises in ruby see [here](http://opalrb.org/blog/2014/05/07/promises-in-opal/).

```ruby
class Contacts < Volt::ModelController
  def hello
    promise = LoggingTasks.log('Hello World!')
  end
end
```

You can use the ```#then``` method of the returned promise to get the result of the call.  You can use the ```#fail``` method on the promise to get any thrown errors.

```ruby
MathTasks.add(23, 5).then do |result|
  # result should be 28
  alert result
end.fail do |error|
  puts "Error: #{error}"
end
```
