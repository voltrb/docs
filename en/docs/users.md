# Users

Users are a core component of most web apps.  To help standardize things, Volt builds users into the framework.

## Note

Some features in users are still a work in process. (as of Nov 9, 2014)  The plan is to add [omniauth](https://github.com/intridea/omniauth) support to be able login through third party services.  Right now only a email or username/password option is provided.

## Working with Users

Volt ships with the [volt-user-tempates](https://github.com/voltrb/volt-user-templates) gem out of the box.  First we'll see how to use users, then we'll talk about how to create your own signup and login pages.

volt-user-templates provides signup and login templates you render via the default main route template.  Volt provides routes at ```/signup``` and ```/login``` in ```routes.rb``` or you can render the templates using a tag, see the [volt-user-templates readme](https://github.com/voltrb/volt-user-templates) for more info.

You can access the current user model with ```Volt.user```  This will return a user model if the user is logged in.  If the user is not logged in, it will return ```nil```.

## Restricting Models

Volt provides helpers to ensure that models can only be modified by certain users.

## Logging In

You can login a user with:

```ruby
Volt.login(login, password)
```

```login``` can be either the username or email based on the config.  ```Volt.login``` returns a [promise](http://opalrb.org/blog/2014/05/07/promises-in-opal/) that resolves on a successful login, or fails with an error message on an unsuccessful login.

```ruby
Volt.login(email, password).then do
  # redirect on successful login
  go '/dashboard'
end.fail do |error|
  # login failed with an error
  flash._errors << error
end
```

## Logging Out

You can logout by calling:

```ruby
Volt.logout
```

This returns immediately and triggers a change event on ```Volt.user```

## Creating Users

To see an example of creating users, see [volt-user-templates](https://github.com/voltrb/volt-user-templates).

Volt provides a ```Volt::User``` class that any model can inherit from by a model.  By default Volt provides a User model in app/main/models/user.rb  By default
```Volt::User``` uses the ```email``` property as the login, however you can configure an app to use ```username``` instead.  In ```config/app.rb``` you can add:

```ruby
config.public.auth.use_username = true
```

```Volt::User``` provides validations on ```email``` or ```username```  Passwords can be stored in the ```password``` property.  Passwords will be hashed using [bcrypt](https://github.com/codahale/bcrypt-ruby) and stored in ```hashed_password```  You should not need to deal with ```hashed_password``` directly.

To create a user, you can use the normal store collection:

```ruby
def index
  self.model = store._users.buffer
end
```

You can use [volt-fields](https://github.com/voltrb/volt-fields) to show any errors when creating a user.

You can find more on users in the [source code](http://www.github.com/voltrb/volt/tree/master/app/volt/models/user.rb).
