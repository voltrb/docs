## Buffers

Because the store collection is automatically synced to the backend, any change to a model's property will result in all other clients seeing the change immediately.  Often this is not the desired behavior.  To facilitate building [CRUD](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Create,_read,_update_and_delete) apps, Volt provides the concept of a "buffer".  A buffer can be created from one model and will not save data back to its backing model until .save! is called on it.  This lets you create a form thats not saved until a submit button is pressed.

```ruby
    store._items << {name: 'Item 1'}

    item1 = store._items[0]

    item1_buffer = item1.buffer

    item1_buffer._name = 'Updated Item 1'
    item1_buffer._name
    # => 'Updated Item 1'

    item1._name
    # => 'Item 1'

    item1_buffer.save!

    item1_buffer._name
    # => 'Updated Item 1'

    item1._name
    # => 'Updated Item 1'
```

```#save!``` on buffer also returns a [promise](http://opalrb.org/blog/2014/05/07/promises-in-opal/) that will resolve when the data has been saved back to the server.

```ruby
    item1_buffer.save!.then do
      puts "Item 1 saved"
    end.fail do |err|
      puts "Unable to save because #{err}"
    end
```

Calling .buffer on an existing model will return a buffer for that model instance.  If you call .buffer on a Volt::ArrayModel (plural sub-collection), you will get a buffer for a new item in that collection.  Calling .save! will then add the item to that sub-collection as if you had done << to push the item into the collection.

More on buffers can be found in the [source code](https://github.com/voltrb/volt/blob/master/lib/volt/models/buffer.rb).
